### Short description of your proposed exhibition
Below, just a point is a light installation which reveals the sensual intersection between data points whose effects are unquantifiable because they’re unavailable and data points whose effects are only too quantifiable, but not searchable.


This installation wants to highlight the cause and effect relationship between property transactions —often happening unbeknownst to and to the detriment of inhabitants— and the amount of sunlight that these inhabitants are exposed to. On a very physical level, property transfer results directly in the construction of ever-higher rises, following a logic of most value extraction from the land, which in turn manifests itself through a net disappearance of sunlight for current tenants and neighbors upon completion of the construction work.


On the one side, then, data quantifying the amount of sunlight that urban zones are exposed to throughout the year is well documented, and visualized using current state-of-the-art technology from both specialized outlets (MAS - Municipal Arts Society), and broadsheet publications (NYT - New York Times); it is the very experience of seeing the light disappear that prevents readers and audience members to truly experience what it meant, not to live in shadows, but to see the light disappear.


On the other side, as the buildings rise, they obfuscate the original act of their creation —the financial exchange of mortgages— as they get buried deeper and deeper into the ACRIS database, supposedly open, yet hardly searchable, hardly findable, only remnants of deeds.

### Proposal submission
Through a data point, darkly consists in three main components. A projector, a set of moveable pieces articulated by DC motors and controlled by a Raspberry Pi, and a set of documents from the ACRIS database being projected. Placed right in front of the projector lens, the moveable pieces slowly rise to the pace at which a given set of buildings is expected to be completed within a neighborhood in New York City, gradually obstructing the light from the projector, casting their shadow on the projected documents, a set of mortgage transactions which have allowed that construction to happen in the first place. As the light gets obstructed from below, the impression is that of these legal documents disappearing. Once the automated, makeshift building silhouette has completely covered the light, the system resets and moves on to another lot, another mortgage, another construction.
